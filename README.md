# CarbonZero - SoC Final Project

## 🧐 Problem statement 
As a team we decided to focus on the issue of climate change. Based on our market research we discovered that people want to know what their carbon footprint looks like so that they can do more to reduce their own personal impact in their daily lives. Our problem statement became, "Our planet is warming up, but I don't know what my impact is or how to improve it."

## 💡 Solution  
Our solution was to build CarbonZero - an app which helps to give people awareness of their impact on climate change through their daily activities and delivers tailored education on how they could make a positive change.

## 🚀 Future scope
- Implement a sign-out function to allow users to log out of the app.
- Expand the questionnaire with additional sets of adaptive questions based on initial responses.
- Enhance the app with sound effects and music corresponding to questionnaire scores, creating a celebratory atmosphere for positive results.
- Set up email reminders to prompt users with recommended actions for reducing their carbon footprint.
- Introduce a rewards section where users can receive special gifts and discounts based on their questionnaire scores and app usage. These rewards will promote environmentally friendly options for travel, food, energy, and clothing.
- Offer a subscription option for users to receive a newsletter with further information, helping to promote the app.
- Use social media pages and YouTube videos as promotional platforms for the app.

## 🏫 Lessons learned 
- Planning before coding is very important and it goes a long way
- All secretive information should be stored in the .env & .gitignore files so that it doesn't get pushed to Github
- Netlify only accepts the lastest version of a library
- Once we started building our app, we realised the importance of having an in-depth component tree
- Pair programming is crucial to collaborative problem solving
- Having a good understanding of our tech stack and being able to justify why we are using it
- Working with unfamiliar tech libraries
- The importance of getting user feedback to ensure our app meets their needs
